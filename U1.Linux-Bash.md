# More About the most used commands
### cd
`cd <directory>` - change directory

If there are spaces in a directory name, put a backslash "\" before every space.
i.e `cd definitely\ homework\ pls\ no\ look`

### ls
`ls` - List the files directories in the current directory.

The `-a` option includes hidden files, which in Linux are files whose names start with a `.` character.
*i.e* `ls -la` use a long listing format (-l) and prints all files+hidden files (-a) in a directory.

### mkdir
`mkdir` - make a folder
The `-p` option allows for all necessary folders to be made when requesting to create a folder in one that doesn't exist yet.

### cp
`cp <originalFile> <newFile>` - copy a file
