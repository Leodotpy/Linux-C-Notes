# Unit 4: C Programming :🇨 👨‍💻

C is a general-purpose programming language that is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application programming.

### Types, Operators and Expressions

**Types**: C has several built-in data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, and characters. There are also user-defined types, such as structures and arrays.

**Operators**: C has various operators that are used to perform mathematical and logical operations. Some examples include arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /), comparison operators (==, !=, >, <), and logical operators (&&, ||, !).

**Expressions**: In C, an expression is a combination of operators, variables, and literals that can be evaluated to produce a value. For example, `x + 5` is an expression that adds the value of x to 5.

### Control Flow

**Conditional Statements**: C has if-else statements that are used to execute code based on a condition. For example:

```c
if (x > 10) {
  printf("x is greater than 10");
} else {
  printf("x is less than or equal to 10");
}
``` 

**Loops**: C has three types of loops: for, while, and do-while. Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. For example:


```c
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  printf("%d ", i);
}

int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  printf("%d ", i);
  i++;
}

int i = 0;
do {
  printf("%d ", i);
  i++;
} while (i < 10);
``` 

### Input and Output

**Input**: C has several functions for reading input, including `scanf` and `fgets`. For example:

```c
int x;
scanf("%d", &x);
``` 

**Output**: C has the `printf` function for outputting formatted data. For example:

```c
int x = 5;
printf("The value of x is %d", x);
``` 

### Functions and Program Structure

**Functions**: C allows the definition of functions that can be called from other parts of the program. For example:

```c
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
``` 

**Program Structure**: A C program typically has a main function that is the entry point of the program. The main function can call other functions defined in the program.

### Pointers and Arrays

**Pointers**: Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. They are used to manipulate memory and to pass variables by reference. For example:

```c
int x = 5;
int *p = &x; // p points to the memory address of x
``` 

**Arrays**: Arrays are used to store a collection of values of the same type. For example:

```c
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
``` 

### Structures

**Structures**: Structures are user-defined data types that can hold multiple variables of different types. They are used to group related data together. For example:

```c
struct Person {
  char name[50];
  int age;
  float height;
};

struct Person p1 = {"John", 30, 1.75};
```

## **typedef in C programming language**

In C programming language, `typedef` is a keyword used to create new data types. The `typedef` keyword is used to define a new type name for an existing data type.

Using `typedef`, we can define a new type name for an existing data type. This can be useful in many situations, such as when we want to create a shorter or more descriptive name for a data type or when we want to abstract away the implementation details of a complex data type.

### **Syntax of typedef**

The syntax of typedef is as follows:

```c
typedef <existing_data_type> <new_type_name>;
``` 

Here, `existing_data_type` is the data type for which we want to create a new type name, and `new_type_name` is the new name that we want to give to this data type.

### **Examples of typedef**

Let's look at some examples of how `typedef` can be used in C programming:

```c
// Define a new type name for the data type int
typedef int myint;

// Define a new type name for the data type struct student
typedef struct {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float gpa;
} Student;
``` 

In the above code examples, we created new type names for the data types `int` and `struct student`. We defined a new type name `myint` for the `int` data type and `Student` for the `struct student` data type.

### **Benefits of using typedef**

Using `typedef` in C programming language can provide several benefits:

1.  **Simplifies code:** Typedef can simplify code by creating shorter and more descriptive names for complex data types.
    
2.  **Abstraction:** Typedef can be used to abstract away the implementation details of a complex data type. This can make the code easier to read and maintain.
    
3.  **Code portability:** Typedef can be used to create data types that are portable across different platforms and architectures. This can make the code more portable and reusable.


# Example Code

## File
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

#define OUTPUTFILE "sineTable.dat"
#define PI acos(-1.0)

int main(void) {
    // open file as fp
    FILE *fp = fopen(OUTPUTFILE, "w");

    // user input
    int input;
    scanf("%i", &input);

    // print to file
    fprintf(fp, "    x sin(x)\n");
    for (int i = 1; i <= input; i++){
        fprintf(fp,"%.3lf %.4lf\n", (i * PI/input), sin(i* PI/input));	
    }
    return 0;
}
```


## Pointers

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 7;
    printf("x is %d\n", x); // Prints: x is 7

    x = 14;
    printf("x is %d\n", x); // Prints: x is 14

    // Declare a pointer variable that points to the memory address of x
    int *aptr = &x;
    printf("aptr is %x\n", aptr); // Prints: aptr is the memory address of x ie bea54240
    
    // Dereference the pointer and print the value stored at that memory address
    printf("x is %d\n", *aptr); // Prints: x is the value stored at 
                                // the memory address of x which is 14

    return 0;
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Define an array of 5 integers
    int somenumbers[5];
    // Declare a pointer variable that points to the first element of the array
    int *ptr = somenumbers; // Equivalent to &somenumbers[0]
    // Declare and initialize an integer variable to 2
    int v = 2;
    
    // Loop through the array using the pointer variable
    for (; ptr < &somenumbers[5]; ptr++) {
        // Assign the current element of the array with the current value of v
        *ptr = v;
        // Double the value of v for the next element
        v = v * 2;
    }
 
    // Loop through the array and print each element
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", somenumbers[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
