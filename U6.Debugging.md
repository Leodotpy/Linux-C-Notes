# Unit 6: Testing, Debugging, and Profiling üêõüîç

## GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

GCC is a suite of compilers for various programming languages, including C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, D, and others.

### Basic GCC Usage

* **`gcc`**: Compile a C source file.
* **`g++`**: Compile a C++ source file.
* **`-o`**: Specify the output file name.
* **`-c`**: Compile without linking (create object file).
* **`-Wall`**: Enable all compiler warnings.

```bash
    $ gcc -o my_program my_program.c
    $ ./my_program
```

## GDB (GNU Debugger)

GDB is a command-line debugger for programs written in C, C++, and other languages. It allows you to debug, inspect, and control the execution of a program.

### Basic GDB Usage

* **`gdb`**: Start the debugger with the specified program.
* **`run`**: Start the program.
* **`break`**: Set a breakpoint.
* **`continue`**: Resume program execution.
* **`step`**: Execute one line of source code.
* **`next`**: Execute one line of source code, stepping over function calls.
* **`print`**: Display the value of an expression.
* **`quit`**: Exit GDB.

```bash
$ gcc -g -o my_program my_program.c
$ gdb my_program
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
(gdb) next
(gdb) print my_variable
(gdb) quit
```

## Valgrind 
Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. It provides a suite of tools for debugging and profiling programs.

### Memcheck

Memcheck is a Valgrind tool for detecting memory management issues, such as memory leaks, invalid memory accesses, and uninitialized variables.

* **`valgrind`**: Run a program with Valgrind and the specified tool.
* **`--tool`**: Specify the Valgrind tool to use.
* **`--leak-check`**: Perform leak checking.
* **`--show-leak-kinds`**: Specify which leak kinds to report.

```bash
$ gcc -g -o my_program my_program.c
$ valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./my_program
```

# Code Profiling
Profiling allows for the analysis of a code execution:
* Performance
* Use of CPU/memory resources
* Use of specific library/system calls
* etc.

Typically done using ‚Äúcode instrumentation‚Äù
* Modifying the source code to change its behaviour
* Typically during compilation or running code through emulation
* Example: wrap each call to a function, keep track of:
* when it starts and when it ends
* which function calls which other function (call graphs)
* use of resources

## GProf
Gprof can be used to measure code performance
Code instrumentation, keeps track of time execution of each function call
Reports functions that are called often, take longer
Requires compilation with `-pg` flag
`gcc ‚Äìpg -o ./executable file.c ‚Ä¶`

Running executable creates a gmon.out file to be created
* This file can be interpreted with gprof command:
`./executable`
`gprof executable gmon.out`
