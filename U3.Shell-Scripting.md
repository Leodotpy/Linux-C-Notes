## Bracket usage in Bash

In Bash, you can use various types of brackets to specify conditions and perform operations.

### Square brackets `[ ]`

Square brackets are used to test conditions in `if` statements and other constructs.

The syntax is:
```bash
if [ condition ]; then
  # commands to run if condition is true
fi
```

#### Testing file characteristics

You can test file characteristics using square brackets. Run `man test` to learn more

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-e` | File exists | `[ -e file.txt ]` |
| `-d` | File is a directory | `[ -d directory ]` |
| `-f` | File is a regular file | `[ -f file.txt ]` |
| `-r` | File is readable | `[ -r file.txt ]` |
| `-w` | File is writable | `[ -w file.txt ]` |
| `-x` | File is executable | `[ -x file.txt ]` |

For example, to check if a file exists and is readable:
```bash
if [ -e file.txt -a -r file.txt ]; then
  echo "file.txt exists and is readable"
else
  echo "file.txt either doesn't exist or is not readable"
fi
```

Output:
`file.txt exists and is readable` 

#### Testing string characteristics

You can test string characteristics using square brackets.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `=` | Strings are equal | `[ "string1" = "string2" ]` |
| `!=` | Strings are not equal | `[ "string1" != "string2" ]` |
| `-z` | String is empty | `[ -z "string" ]` |
| `-n` | String is not empty | `[ -n "string" ]` |

For example, to check if a string is not empty:
```bash
string="hello"
if [ -n "$string" ]; then
  echo "The string is not empty"
else
  echo "The string is empty"
fi
```

Output:
`The string is not empty` 

### Curly braces `{ }`

Curly braces are used to specify sequences of values.

The syntax is:
```bash
for value in {start..end}; do
  # commands to run for each value
done
```
For example, to print the numbers from 1 to 5:

```bash
for number in {1..5}; do
  echo $number
done
```

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

#### Sequences Continued: The `seq` Command
The `seq` command is used to generate sequences of numbers.

The syntax is:

`seq [OPTION]... LAST
seq [OPTION]... FIRST LAST
seq [OPTION]... FIRST INCREMENT LAST` 

Where `FIRST` is the first number in the sequence, `LAST` is the last number in the sequence, and `INCREMENT` is the step value (defaults to 1).

### Options:

* `-f` format string: allows you to specify a format string for the output
* `-s` separator string: allows you to specify a separator string between the numbers

### Examples:

* To generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5:
`seq 5` 

Output:
`1
2
3
4
5` 

* To generate a sequence of numbers from 3 to 8 with a step of 2:
`seq 3 2 8` 

Output:
`3
5
7` 

* To generate a sequence of numbers with a custom format:
```bash
seq -f "Number %02g" 1 10
```

Output:
`Number 01
Number 02
Number 03
Number 04
Number 05
Number 06
Number 07
Number 08
Number 09
Number 10` 

* To generate a sequence of numbers with a custom separator:
```bash
seq -s ", " 1 10
```

Output:
`1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`

### Parentheses `( )`

Parentheses are used to execute commands in a subshell.

The syntax is:

`(command1; command2; ...)` 

For example, to change the current directory and run a command:

```bash
(cd ~/; ls)
```

Output:
`[list of files in the home directory]`

### Angle brackets `< >`

Angle brackets are used to redirect input and output in Bash.

#### Redirecting input (`<`)

The syntax is:

`command < inputfile` 

For example, to sort a list of numbers stored in a file:

`sort < numbers.txt` 

#### Redirecting output (`>`)

The syntax is:

```bash
command > outputfile
```

For example, to save the output of `ls` in a file:

```bash
ls > filelist.txt
```

#### Appending output (`>>`)

The syntax is:

```bash
command >> outputfile
```

For example, to append the output of `ls` to a file:

```bash
ls >> filelist.txt
```

### Double angle brackets (`<<`)

Double angle brackets are used to specify here documents.

A here document is a way to pass multiple lines of input to a command. The lines are passed as standard input, separated by a line containing only the delimiter.

The syntax is:

```bash
command << delimiter
input
delimiter
```

For example, to create a file with multiple lines of text:

```bash
cat << EOF > file.txt
line 1
line 2
line 3
EOF
```

### User input using `read` command
The `read` command is used to read input from the user in a bash script.

The syntax is:
`read [OPTION]... VARIABLE...` 

Where `VARIABLE` is the name of the variable to store the input.

#### Options:

* `-p` prompt string: allows you to specify a prompt string to display to the user before reading the input
* `-a` array: allows you to read input into an array

#### Examples:

* To read a single line of input:
```bash
read VAR
echo "You entered: $VAR"
```

* To read multiple lines of input into an array:
```bash
read -a ARR
echo "You entered: ${ARR[@]}"
```

* To display a prompt before reading input:
```bash
read -p "Enter your name: " NAME
echo "Hello, $NAME!"
```

## Loops

Loops are a control flow mechanism in programming that allows repeating a block of code multiple times, typically until a certain condition is met. They allow you to automate repetitive tasks and to perform operations on multiple items in a sequence, such as arrays or lists.

### If
```bash
if ...
then
    ...
elif
then
    ...
else
    ...
fi
```
* `fi` ends the if statement
* if conditions usually use `[]`

### While 
```bash
while ...
do
    ...
done
```
* `done` ends the if statement
* runs as long as the condition is **true**

### Until
```bash
until ...
do
    ...
done
```
* `done` ends the if statement
* runs as long as the condition is **false**

### For
```bash
for i in ...
do
    ...
done
```
* `done` ends the if statement
* loop through a sequence using for loops


## Piping in Bash
**Piping** in Bash to combine commands. i.e `ls` to `grep` to find files with a specific extension `ls | grep '.txt'` or  `ls` to `sort` as `ls | sort` `find` look for characters. Use wildcards to use best. i.e `find . -name "*.txt"` would print all txt files in the current directory.

Piping allows you to redirect the output of one command as the input to another command.

The syntax is:

`command1 | command2` 

Where `command1` is the first command, and `command2` is the second command that will receive the output of `command1` as its input.

### Examples:

* To pipe the output of `ls` to `grep` to find files with a specific extension:

```bash
ls | grep '.txt'
``` 

* To pipe the output of `ls` to `sort` to sort the files in a directory:

```bash
ls | sort
```

* To pipe the output of `ps` to `grep` to find a specific process:

```bash
ps | grep 'firefox'
```
Piping is a powerful feature of Bash that allows you to chain multiple commands together to create complex pipelines for processing data.

# Worksheet: Using command chains

### Question
The `PATH` environment variable contains a list of directories, separated by a colon ("`:`"), where executables can be found. Suppose you want to find a list of all unique top-level directories that are represented in the list pointed to by path, as well as the number of times the directory is used, sorted by name. For example, if the `PATH` is:

`/cs/home/username/bin:/usr/share/Modules/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/xsys/bin:/usr/local/sbin `

You want to find the list:
Provide a command that uses multiple commands in a pipe to perform the translation above. Here is a suggested approach:

* Use `echo` to print the value of the variable `$PATH`.
* Convert the colons into newlines. There are multiple ways to do this, but the `tr` command is probably one of the simplest options.
* Extract only the first directory name from the paths. The `cut` command is a good option here, though `awk` and `sed` can also be used.
* Sort the entries in alphabetical order, using a command like `sort`.
* Remove the duplicate entries and count them. The `uniq` command can be useful to provide this functionality.

### Answer
`echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | cut -d'/' -f2 | sort | uniq -c`

*breakdown*
`echo $PATH` print $PATH variable
`tr ':' '\n'` replace all `:` with new lines `\n`
`cut -d'/' -f2` get only the first file directory name (which is column 2 in this case when splitting by `\`)
`sort` sort alphabetically
`uniq -c` removes duplicates in output and adds a count
