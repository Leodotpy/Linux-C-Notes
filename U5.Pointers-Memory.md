# Unit 5: Pointers and memory management : ðŸ“ŒðŸ’¾

## Memory Allocation

Memory allocation is the process of reserving a block of memory for a program to use. It involves assigning memory to variables, data structures, and other program elements during runtime.

### Types of Memory Allocation

There are two types of memory allocation: static and dynamic.

**Static Memory Allocation**: Static memory allocation refers to memory that is allocated at compile time. The size of the memory block is fixed and cannot be changed during runtime. Variables declared using static memory allocation are stored in the data section of memory.

**Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Dynamic memory allocation refers to memory that is allocated during runtime. The size of the memory block can be changed during runtime. Memory is allocated using functions like malloc(), calloc() and realloc(). Variables declared using dynamic memory allocation are stored in the heap section of memory.

## Memory Leaks

Memory leaks occur when memory that has been allocated is not properly deallocated. This can happen when a program terminates without freeing up the memory or when there is a bug in the code that prevents the memory from being freed.

### Memory Management

Memory management is the process of allocating and deallocating memory. Efficient memory management is important for the performance of a program.

**Memory Management Techniques**: There are several memory management techniques used in programming. Some of these techniques include garbage collection, reference counting, and manual memory management.

**Garbage Collection**: Garbage collection is an automatic memory management technique used by some programming languages. It automatically identifies and frees memory that is no longer in use by the program.

**Reference Counting**: Reference counting is a manual memory management technique. It involves keeping track of the number of references to a block of memory. When the number of references reaches zero, the memory is freed.

**Manual Memory Management**: Manual memory management involves manually allocating and deallocating memory. This can be done using functions like malloc() and free().

## Pointers in C

**Pointer**: A variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

### Pointer Declaration

**Syntax**: `data_type *pointer_name;`

**Example**:

```c
int *ptr;
```

### Pointer Initialization

**Syntax**: `pointer_name = &variable_name;`

**Example**:

```c
int num = 10;
int *ptr;
ptr = &num;
```

### Accessing Value Using Pointer

**Syntax**: `*pointer_name`

**Example**:

```c
int num = 10;
int *ptr = &num;
printf("Value of num: %d\n", *ptr);
```

### Pointer Arithmetic

* Incrementing/Decrementing a pointer: `ptr++` / `ptr--`
* Adding/Subtracting an integer: `ptr + n` / `ptr - n`

## C Pointers and Structs

### Using Pointers with Structs

**Struct**: A composite data type that groups variables under a single name.

**Example**:

```c
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

struct Point p1 = {1, 2};
struct Point *ptr = &p1;
```

### Accessing Struct Members with Pointers

**Syntax**: `(*ptr).member_name` or `ptr->member_name`

**Example**:

```c
printf("p1.x: %d\n", (*ptr).x);
printf("p1.y: %d\n", ptr->y);
```

## Dangling Pointers

**Dangling pointer**: A pointer that points to memory that has been freed or deallocated.

### Causes of Dangling Pointers

1.  Deallocating memory while the pointer still points to it.
2.  Using the value of a variable that has gone out of scope.
3.  Improper use of dynamic memory allocation functions.

### Avoiding Dangling Pointers

* Set the pointer to `NULL` after deallocating memory.
* Don't use pointers to local variables outside the scope of the function.
* Use caution when working with dynamic memory allocation functions.

**Example**:

```c
int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
*ptr = 10;
// Perform operations with ptr

free(ptr); // Deallocate memory
ptr = NULL; // Set ptr to NULL to avoid dangling pointer
```

## (Question From Worksheet)
```c
*    // pointer to a memory address
**   // pointer to a pointer (memory address of a memory address)
(*)() // pointer to a function
*[]   // pointer to an array (memory address of an array)

```


# Memory and Pointers Code Examples
*allocate.c*
```c
// Define a function that returns a pointer to a dynamically allocated integer array
int *dynamic_array(int n) {
    // Allocate memory for an integer array of size n using malloc
    int *arr = malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    
    // Check if the memory allocation was successful
    if (arr == NULL) {
        // If malloc returns NULL, it means the memory allocation failed
        // We can handle this error by returning NULL or throwing an exception
        return NULL;
    }
    
    // Initialize the elements of the array with values from 0 to n-1
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] = i;
    }
    
    // Return a pointer to the first element of the array
    return arr;
}
```
`int *dynamic_array(int n)` is declaring a function named `dynamic_array` that takes an integer parameter `n` and returns a pointer to an integer.


```c
struct node {
  int value;
  struct node *next;
};

struct list {
  struct node *head;
};
////////////////////////////////////

#include <stdlib.h>
#include "list.h"

// Define a function that inserts a new node with a given value at the start of a linked list
void list_insert_start(struct list *list, int new_value) {
    // Allocate memory for a new node using malloc
    struct node *new_node = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    
    // Set the value of the new node to the given new_value
    new_node->value = new_value;
    
    // Set the next pointer of the new node to the current head of the linked list
    new_node->next = list->head;
    
    // Set the head of the linked list to the new node
    list->head = new_node;
}

```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {    
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(10 * sizeof(int)); // Allocating memory
    
        if (ptr == NULL) {
            printf("Memory allocation failed.\n");
            return 1;
        }
        /////////////////////
        // No Memory Leak or Dangling Pointer
        free(ptr); // Deallocating memory
        ptr = NULL; // Avoiding dangling pointer
    
        /////////////////////
        // Possible Memory Leak
        // No call to free() - Memory leak
    
        /////////////////////
         // Possible Dangling Pointer
        free(dangling_ptr); // Deallocating memory

        // Dangling pointer (unintentional)
        dangling_ptr[0] = 42; // Undefined behavior
```
